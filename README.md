## Description 

The goal of this project is to provide a configuration for an internal company network and the mechanisms to communicate with outside networks.
By simulating the configured network, one can test not only all communications, but also the security measures applied.

The virtual network uses 2 ranges of public and private IPv4 addresses and 1 range of IPv6 addresses.
It is also ready to accept multiple servers, VLANs and equipments through the use of communication protocols such as NAT/PAT and OSPF.
A visual representation of the network simulated in GNS3 is provided next.
